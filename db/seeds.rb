# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
user = User.create(username: "admin", password: "qwerty123", email: "bernar.berdikul@mail.ru", age: 21)
